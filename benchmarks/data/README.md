# Benchmarks
Datasets to be used in benchmarking studies for offpele.

## Content
_Content under construction_
- `plop_set`: A set of small molecules to parametrize with offpele and OPLS2005 to perform general evaluations.
- `extra_ligands`: Extra ligands to parameterize with offpele and OPLS2005 for a general checking.
- `SMIRNOFF_coverage_set_1`: A set of small molecules whose coverage in OFF was analyzed.
- `hydration_energies`: Some small molecules from the [FreeSolv](https://github.com/MobleyLab/FreeSolv) database to evaluate hydration energies.
- `GPCR`: set of GPCR systems (5c1m, 6dde, and crossPELE)
- `PPI`: set of PPI systems (6y8H, 4ipf)


## Analysis features
_Content under construction_


- Rotamer library comparison between offpele and PlopRotTemp
- Experimental hydration free energies comparison _(inside the PELE-platform)_
- Comparison of parameters between offpele and PlopRotTemp (bonds, angles, dihedrals, nonbonding and OBC)
- Structural comparison between PELE's OPLS and OFF implementations
- Energetic profile comparison in gold-standard systems (previously published)
